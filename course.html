        <b> Mesopotamians built the earliest pyramidal structures, called ziggurats. In ancient times, these were
            brightly painted in gold/bronze. Since they were constructed of sun-dried mud-brick, little remains of them.
            Ziggurats were built by the Sumerians, Babylonians, Elamites, Akkadians, and Assyrians for local religions.
            Each ziggurat was part of a temple complex which included other buildings. The precursors of the ziggurat
            were raised platforms that date from the Ubaid period[6] during the fourth millennium BC. The earliest
            ziggurats began near the end of the Early Dynastic Period.[7] The latest Mesopotamian ziggurats date from
            the 6th century BC.

            Built in receding tiers upon a rectangular, oval, or square platform, the ziggurat was a pyramidal structure
            with a flat top. Sun-baked bricks made up the core of the ziggurat with facings of fired bricks on the
            outside. The facings were often glazed in different colors and may have had astrological significance. Kings
            sometimes had their names engraved on these glazed bricks. The number of tiers ranged from two to seven. It
            is assumed that they had shrines at the top, but there is no archaeological evidence for this and the only
            textual evidence is from Herodotus.[8] Access to the shrine would have been by a series of ramps on one side
            of the ziggurat or by a spiral ramp from base to summit.

            Egypt
            Main article: Egyptian pyramids
            The most famous pyramids are the Egyptian — huge structures built of brick or stone, some of which are among
            the world's largest constructions. They are shaped as a reference to the rays of the sun. Most pyramids had
            a polished, highly reflective white limestone surface, to give them a shining appearance when viewed from a
            distance. The capstone was usually made of hard stone – granite or basalt – and could be plated with gold,
            silver, or electrum and would also be highly reflective.[9] The ancient Egyptians built pyramids from 2700
            BC until around 1700 BC. The first pyramid was erected during the Third Dynasty by the Pharaoh Djoser and
            his architect Imhotep. This step pyramid consisted of six stacked mastabas. The largest Egyptian pyramids
            are those at the Giza pyramid complex.[10] -->
